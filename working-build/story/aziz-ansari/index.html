            <p>Aziz Ansari had a particularly productive 2015, and for that I am incredibly grateful. After wrapping up the last season of <em>Parks and Recreation</em> (RIP), he struck out on his own with both a book, <em>Modern Romance</em>, and his Netflix sitcom, <em>Master of None</em>, both of which nimbly tackled what it means to be a single, overeducated twenty-something in this moment. His clearheaded understanding of our world makes him one of the few celebrities that can effectively channel millennial angst into biting, intelligent pop culture.</p><p>What makes <em>Modern Romance </em>shine isn’t even Aziz’s comedic voice. Instead, it’s his thoroughgoing explanation of so many prevalent dating behaviors impacted by digital technology that made it essential reading this year. Wondering why that cute girl you met at a party last week still hasn’t texted you, driving you to the point of insanity and back? Aziz shows why people do this, as a means of making one more desirable by seeming unavailable. Can’t tell why your continuous “Heyyyy” Tinder messages never quite seem to pan out? Again, he shines a light, suggesting that people only respond when a response seems genuinely crafted. The book is a how-to manual on dating better in the 21st century, and its advice on making one’s first date more memorable than coffee at Kafein helped me land a girlfriend this summer. Thanks, Aziz.</p><p>When <em>Master of None</em> finally dropped in November, Aziz killed it yet again. The show is probably the best piece of millennial entertainment this side of Broad City. <em>Master of None</em> offers nuanced, witty takes on a wide range of important concerns, from dating (again) to being an immigrant child to facing racism as an Indian actor. </p><p>My favorite episode was “Ladies and Gentleman,” exploring the myriad ways that women face harassment and discrimination today. After grandstanding about his feminist viewpoints, Dev (Aziz’s character) fails to credit his girlfriend Rachel’s frustration when a man refuses to acknowledge the two women in their group. Their ensuing argument, both characters speaking candidly about today’s frequently confusing gender politics, ultimately show’s Dev’s shortcomings as a male feminist. It’s a call for understanding for all men to understand their shortcomings and the continued challenges women face, all written and acted so honestly that it never feels contrived or preachy.</p><p>Without a doubt, 2015 was Aziz’s time to shine. There’s nobody else who quite understands the world like him, and we’re all lucky that his voice carried so far this year.</p>
