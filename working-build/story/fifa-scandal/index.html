            <p>Accusations of millions of dollars in bribery, fraud and money laundering led to the arrest of seven FIFA officials indicted by the United States Department of Justice, starting in May, and have recently led to even more arrests abroad in Europe. 
</p>
<p>FIFA, the world’s football governing body, has had decades of allegations of corruption against the corporation and its head officials. The FBI conducted a three-year long investigation, which targeted the top officials of the multi-billion-dollar organization. Many of the charges were brought hard against South and Central American FIFA officials, authorities said. 
</p>
<p>Authorities promised to follow the initial charges followed by additional arrests. The pressure and scrutiny also led to the suspension of FIFA’s former president Sepp Blatter, who had been recently re-elected. The organization continued to place more than 15 officials on leave involving different levels of corruption such as the black-market sale of World Cup tickets, according to the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html?_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>. 
</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funds have been traced through at least 40 different countries, according to Richard Weber, the chief of the criminal investigation unit of the Internal Revenue Service. Recently, in early December, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/sports/soccer/fifa-scandal-16-more-charged-after-zurich-raid.html" target="_blank">16 new defendants</a> were charged with corruption by Swiss authorities, including Rafael Callejas, the former president of Honduras. The investigation performed by the U.S. Department of Justice will continue despite FIFA’s promises of reform, continuing intense legal scrutiny over top officials. 
</p>
<p>Prior to these investigations, few allegations of corruption involving FIFA had led to impactful consequences on the organization. Recently-found examples of corruption include the “payments relating to tournaments that have already been played, as well as matches scheduled into the next decade,” said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. 
</p>
<p>FIFA released a statement consenting and cooperating with the recent Swiss arrests and investigation, saying it would “continue to cooperate fully with the U.S. investigation as permitted by Swiss law, as well as with the investigation being led by the Swiss Office of the Attorney General.” </p>
