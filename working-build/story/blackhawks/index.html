            <p>I still have the alarms saved on my phone for 6:00, 6:10, 6:15 and 6:20 a.m. with different labels propelling me to wake up and get on the train to downtown Chicago to be a part of the red sea that was the Blackhawks Stanley Cup Championship parade.</p><p>The Blackhawks won yet another Stanley Cup in 2015, making it their third in six years and sixth overall. It was also the first time since 1938 that the Blackhawks won the cup on home ice.</p><p>The Blackhawks beat the Nashville Predators, swept the Minnesota Wild, and clinched their spot in the Stanley Cup Finals by defeating the Anaheim Ducks. They went on to defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning, winning the series 4-2.</p><p>As could be expected, the city went wild. An estimated two million fans attended the parade held in the team’s honor. Another 60,000 who were lucky enough to snag free tickets to the following rally in Solider Field heard speeches by players and coaches and watched while each player hoisted the cup high above his head with pride. I was one of those lucky people who attended. My best friend (and fellow Blackhawks fan) and I screamed and cheered as videos from the championship run came onto the screens of Soldier Field and danced as Chelsea Dagger, the team’s anthem, was blasted from speakers. Red confetti was spewed onto fans, players and coaches alike.</p><p>Captain Jonathan Toews said to Hawks fans at the rally, "We share this with you, the best fans in the world. Maybe the only way it does get better is if we win four! Let's go!”</p><p>As always, each member of the team got to spend a day with the cup during the offseason. The trophy flew all over the world, visiting multiple countries, as the players often bring the cup to their hometowns to celebrate with the people who were with them from the start.</p><p>During his speech at the rally, the Stanley Cup playoffs MVP and defenseman Duncan Keith said, "Let's keep this red machine going, baby!” Here’s to 2016.</p>
