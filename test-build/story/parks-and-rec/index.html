            <p>Ain’t no finale like a Leslie Knope finale, because a Leslie Knope finale aired 13 television episodes in just seven weeks this year. “One Last Ride,” the series finale of <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, aired in February and <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/25/tuesday-final-ratings-the-voice-adjusted-up-ncis-ncis-new-orleans-fresh-off-the-boat-new-girl-tvs-hottest-commercials-adjusted-down/367490/" target="_blank">was seen</a> by over 4 million viewers.</p>
<p>Affectionately known as <em>Parks and Rec</em>, the mockumentary-style NBC sitcom centered around an energetic, ambitious and enthusiastic government employee – the fabulous Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation in Pawnee, Indiana – as well as her friends and coworkers. For seven seasons, we watched Leslie, her small parks department and her quaint, obese town grow up. Through romantic mishaps and triumphs, government slip-ups and bureaucratic incompetencies and career changes, <em>Parks and Rec</em> developed and maintained a cult following.</p>
<p>The show started off with some rocky criticism, as some believed it was too similar to fellow NBC workplace mockumentary <em>The Office</em>, but <em>Parks and Rec</em> proved itself early on. Nominated for dozens of awards for almost every season – including a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/awards" target="_blank">handful</a> of Emmys and Golden Globe Awards – the show seemed to improve as time went on, bringing in new characters and maturing current ones.</p>
<p>Even though we know what happens to everyone in the Parks gang decades into the future, it’s still sad to see them go. From Li’l Sebastian (RIP) and “Jerry!” moments to Leslie Knope compliments and Ron Swanson’s mustache, <em>Parks and Rec</em> will forever be one of my favorite shows – a fond go-to on rainy days, during stressed out study breaks and marathon binges. The characters are extremely well-developed and real that it’s hard not to imagine yourself working alongside the <em>Parks and Rec</em> crew. As a waffle fanatic with a “beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk-ox” roommate who balances out my crazy, I can’t help but identify (very strongly) with Leslie Knope. As soon as the last season starts streaming on Netflix, you can find me treating myself to a nostalgic binge.</p>
