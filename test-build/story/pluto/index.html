        <div class="entry-body">
            <p>2015 has been an immensely successful year for space in pop culture, with news topics ranging from the <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/04/box-office-report-the-martian-sicario" target="_blank">breakout hit of <em>The Martian</em></a> to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars" target="_blank">discovery of liquid water on Mars</a>. But the event that perhaps best captured social media’s “heart” this year was New Horizons’ Pluto flyby. 
</p>
<p>The flyby was the culmination of a three-billion mile, decades-long NASA mission to explore the last planet in our solar system (and yes, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/01/jan-19-2006-new-horizons/" target="_blank">Pluto still <em>was</em> classified as a planet</a> when the probe was launched in 2006). For the project to be considered a success, the New Horizons probe would have to travel for almost ten years through the vastness of space, where even a single unexpected asteroid hit or computer glitch could irreversibly destroy the <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/14/Here-s-What-It-Cost-Send-NASA-s-New-Horizons-Pluto" target="_blank">$720 million project</a>. Consequently, tensions ran high in the mission control room when New Horizons was scheduled to file its report from radio silence.
</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/science/space/nasa-new-horizons-spacecraft-reaches-pluto.html" target="_blank">July 14</a>, NASA’s hard work was rewarded with a quick status update from New Horizons. Not only had the probe survived, but it would also be sending back reams of data from Pluto’s surface. Pluto, once only seen as a fuzzy gray blur, would now greet Earth with a heart, revealing a richly complex world never explored before.
</p>
<p>Upon confirmation of New Horizon’s success, cheers erupted in the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, prompting a huge wave of celebration to break out over social media. Two highlights included President Obama’s <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/621133763385425920" target="_blank">tweet</a>, which broke 21,000 retweets, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jXazEYi3P8" target="_blank">Stephen Colbert’s interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> regarding the discovery, which reached a million views on the same day.
</p>
<p>The New Horizon’s mission <a href="http://www.space.com/29988-new-horizons-pluto-probe-future.html" target="_blank">isn’t over yet</a>. Until late 2016, the probe will continue to send even higher-resolution images and data from Pluto’s surface and its moons, and potential flybys of other objects in the Kuiper Belt may still be planned. 
</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the New Horizons’ flyby also marked the <a href="http://www.space.com/29932-pluto-flyby-anniversary-mariner-4-mars.html" target="_blank">50th anniversary of the first Mars flyby by NASA’s Mariner 4</a> on July 14, 1965: a full-circle “capstone,” as mission project manager Glen Fountain <a href="http://www.space.com/29929-pluto-flyby-new-horizons-spacecraft.html" target="_blank">stated</a>, of humanity’s “initial reconnaissance of our solar system – giving us a new perspective about how we as human beings fit into the universe.”</p>
