<td>To stave off pre-college nerves, I pored over campus publications.&nbsp;I became well-versed in the relative&nbsp;values of meal plans, the Norris establishments that preceded Frontera Fresco and what the controversy surrounding the <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/story/bailey-issues-statement-on-fucksaw-demonstration/">fucksaw in the Human Sexuality class</a>&nbsp;was all about. But the Northwestern experience can't be distilled into keywords and know-how, as I soon found out.</td>

<td>Making Time for Things That Matter&nbsp;</td>
<td>Adjusting to new schedules is a process made simpler with each passing quarter. Filling those schedules with things that matter and leaving room for unscheduled yet no less important spontaneity, however, is a skill I'm still trying to master. I want to look back on these past four years confident&nbsp;that I gave my time generously to people and causes I care about, that I also took time for myself and that sometimes, just sometimes, I got my eight hours of shut-eye.</td>

<td>NBN 201-1</td>
<td><em>North by Northwestern</em> Magazine</td>
<td>Everything I know about journalism, I learned from <em>North by Northwestern</em>. And I'm not talking about breaking the Oxford comma habit or spelling numbers below 10. I mean the messy space between journalism and humanity, between being a student editor and a friend.&nbsp;</td>

<td>In moving away from Evanston for seven months&mdash;three for the summer, three for JR and one somewhere in between&mdash;I saw just how much my college experiences shaped my interests. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?&nbsp;</td>

<td>TK 110-5</td>
<td>Discovering What's TK</td>
<td>Chaotic as it can be, our quarter system breeds a sense of comfort in what's to come. If you forget to complete your CTECs, you can do them&nbsp;in the next round. If you're in an uninteresting class, you can ride out the tide in 10 weeks. If you overcommit yourself, you can start afresh next season. These prepackaged chunks of time stand in contrast to our temporally ambiguous post-grad futures. I'm scared shitless, I'll admit, but I think I'm starting to be okay with that. I'm okay with not being able to count the credits I have left and fit them into their corresponding quarters&nbsp;or with no majors, clubs and institutional affiliations to ground my sense of self. I'm okay. The rest? It's still TK, TK, TK.</td>
