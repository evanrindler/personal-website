            <p>People’s general conception of the seriousness of politics makes anything less proper seem incongruent. Therefore, Donald Trump has easily stood out. And so does the musical “Hamilton” (on a much better ground though).</p>
<p>If you can’t imagine hip-hop and one of the nation’s founding father being linked together, watch “Hamilton” and be convinced. The daring way of enacting Alexander Hamilton’s personal life and his ambition for the country runs parallel to the daring way Hamilton lived his own life, by throwing himself at battles and confrontations, and fearlessly facing both glorious victories and humiliating defeats. </p>
<p>The musical made its Off-Broadway debut at The Public Theatre in New York in February, and was later transferred to Broadway on August 6 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. It’s not hard to tell that people have loved it. When “Hamilton” opened on Broadway, it had a multimillion-dollar advance in ticket sales, and its engagement off-Broadway was sold out. It has also become the second highest-grossing show on Broadway for the Labor Day week, right after “The Lion King.”</p>
<p>Written, composed and also performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (as Hamilton), the show was inspired by the 2004 biography by historian Ron Chernow on the first Secretary of the Treasury when Miranda casually purchased the book at the airport to read during his vacation. In the staged performance, Miranda successfully condensed almost all major aspects of Hamilton’s life: his orphaned childhood, his rivalry with Aaron Burr, his marriage with Elizabeth Schuyler, his attack on Jefferson’s belief in a country dominated by elites, and of course, the duel that put a full stop to his life. More importantly, Hamilton’s spirit is instilled in every scene. Be it the abandoned boy in the Caribbean, or the accomplished politician of a fledgling nation, Hamilton never ceased fighting for his voice and reputation as an outsider. At the same time, his story inspires even more people from disadvantaged backgrounds like his to think about their ambition for life. And the show recently announced its first national tour for Chicago in Sept. 2016 – get excited, Northwestern. </p>
<p>Ben Brantley summed up the play quite well in the New York Times: “I loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show. But ’Hamilton,’ directed by Thomas Kail and starring Mr. Miranda, might just about be worth it.” </p>
