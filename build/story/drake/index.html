            <p>Drake, I only wish I used to call you on my cell phone.</p><p>Drizzy’s had quite the career, from his humble beginnings on Degrassi as <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/a8/a823ddc3cf44480d5c045cddcae397df7d1f37993bf77c63d6c71006ed5e86c2.jpg" target="_blank">Wheelchair Jimmy</a> to making every girl in the world swoon by declaring we were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGt4DOl411o" target="_blank">beautiful in our sweats</a>. But 2015 was his biggest year yet, most notably for releasing two of 2015’s best albums.</p><p>In February, the Toronto-based rapper surprised fans with <em>If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late</em>, the first <a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2015/02/drake-if-youre-reading-this-its-too-late-funny-cover-art" target="_blank">album</a> in 2015 to sell <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6656838/drake-million-selling-album-if-youre-reading-this" target="_blank">a million copies</a>. With it, 6God added to his long list of catchphrases – “runnin’ through [insert word] with my woes” might have been this year’s most popular Instagram caption. And in September he did it again by collaborating with Atlanta-based rapper Future for <em>What a Time to be Alive</em>, featuring hits like “Jumpman” and “Big Rings.” </p><p>And that’s just from his albums – some of Drake’s best work of the year came from his rap beef with rapper Meek Mill (don’t worry, Drake didn’t start it). In an infamous <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6641784/meek-mill-drake-timeline" target="_blank">social media war</a> with several rappers weighing in, Drake responded with a song titled “Charged Up,” warning that “6God is watching.” And a couple days later, Drake effectively won the fight by dropping “Back to Back” <a href="https://twitter.com/Drake/status/626304322981105664" target="_blank">overnight</a> (you can listen to the song four times on the walk from Starbucks to Tech: true story).</p><p>Then, of course, “Hotline Bling” happened. </p><p>The song itself was instantly another Drake classic, featuring him crying over a girl with a catchy beat, but what really sealed the deal was the music video that he released in October. In case you somehow missed it, Drake can’t dance – at least, not in these four minutes. And now it’s the year’s best meme. Sufjan Stevens danced to it. Then Donald Trump. MTV said it best with its <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2717911/jon-snow-hotline-bling/" target="_blank">headline</a>: “Jon Snow danced to ‘Hotling Bling,’ which means 2015 is officially over now.”</p><p>But the best Drake contribution of the year didn’t even come from Drake – it came from two tech developers in the short-lived “Drizzy” app. Unfortunately the app is no longer available on the iTunes store, but once upon a time, you could text your angry mother “That’s when you’re the prettiest, I hope that you don’t take it wrong” with just one button.</p><p>Good job this year, Drake – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP6ps5CxgVk" target="_blank">I’m so I’m so I’m so proud of you</a>.</p>
