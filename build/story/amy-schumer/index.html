            <p>Walk into a sorority house – any given day, any given hour – and I guarantee someone is watching Amy Schumer.
</p> 
<p>The quotable comic has a way of relating to every girl who watches her, whether it be on her Emmy-winning sketch comedy television show <em>Inside Amy Schumer</em>, HBO special or hit movie <em>Trainwreck</em>. She values characteristics that women often grow up thinking they should be ashamed about, from body type to drinking habits. While media and society often denigrate women for straying from the norm when it comes to these categories, Schumer celebrates the differences, showing that we should appreciate them too. Using self-deprecation, a large part of Schumer’s humor, she shows women everywhere that we are normal and that what we’re doing is normal.
</p> 
<p>Schumer brings up important issues, but in no way does she shove her opinion down your throat. Instead, Schumer makes you laugh while watching a sketch about <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpsI8mWKmg” target=blank”>Hollywood’s double standard of aging in men and women</a>. Clever and hilarious, Schumer gets her searing message across without you even noticing.
</p> 
<p>This year Schumer dominated every platform she took on. She tackled stand up, sketch comedy and the big screen, and walked away victorious from every one. She arose from Long Island and landed in the spotlight, following the lineage of female comics before her who together showcase that, yes, women are funny. And that women are funny in low-cut mini-dresses, while talking about threesomes or burping or drinking cheap beer.</p>
<p>She is a role model that women need. Not a proper lady, not a stick thin model, but someone who is unapologetically herself. She may not be the thinnest, the prettiest or the most fashionable celebrity out there, but that’s what makes her so relatable and inspirational. She doesn’t care what anyone else thinks when she drinks a whole bottle of wine on stage at the Apollo, and neither should you.</p>
