            <p> Dad cries on the couch when I come from school. The TV is playing a re-run of the 1980’s NCAA basketball playoffs, but judging from the snot worms crawling out his nose, it isn’t loss of Duke to the South Central Nebraska War Eagles making him upset. I retrieve a box of tissues from the restroom and, after a moment’s thought, pat him on the back. After he blows his nose, he tells me it was the Lieberman’s eldest son today. A jogger found his body lodged in a storm drain in the park, stuck for enough time for animals and running water to make identification tricky. <br/></p><p> Then, my mom comes in the room and tells me that we’ll be going to the Shiva so I’d better dig up a polo shirt that isn’t wrinkled. Dad attempts to smile when a corn-fed point guard with red shorts drains a 3-pointer on screen, but he just looks like a melted SpongeBob popsicle. I leave for my bedroom and, realizing that I can still hear his mewling down the hall, put in my headphones. I forego the typical afternoon masturbation session and do my French homework.</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> Sometimes, my Dad finds out that people die before anyone else other than God. He’s a dentist, you see. The X-rays come to him after fires and nasty accidents, or when bodies turn up in the Chesapeake Bay. The authorities need him to check the dental records and confirm the body. So the police have a hunch, that’s for sure, but it’s his word which seal the deal.</p><p> If you don’t see what I mean, think about it this way – sometimes they say, “Hey, does this look like the teeth of Johnny Doe? Any chance he was your patient?” Then my Dad will take a look in the files and report back, “Nope. The second bicuspid profile isn’t deep enough” or whatever. He’s expected to give technical, verifiable data, though I expect a serial killer dentist could just make it all up and cover his tracks. It’s easy to lie over email these days. But should he come up empty handed, for good or nefarious reason, then it’s back to square one for the authorities. Meanwhile, the families don’t get any peace.</p><p> Officer Joe calls them up: “Remember when we said that the unidentified corpse found by the highway might be your daughter? Well, we received confirmation that it wasn’t. Yes, your dentist was sure. Yes, they might still be out there.”</p><p> And then he sticks his hands in those poor, hopeful people’s mouths and reminds them to floss.</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> My mom drives us to the Shiva in the Dad’s Passat, because her Subaru’s bright blue and I assume to crude for the funeral mood.</p><p> Sorry. When Eminem does it, it almost sounds cool.</p><p> Julia doesn’t have to go because she has volleyball practice, which means she’ll come home late and scarf dinner before starting Calculus or whatever (certainly not reruns of Gilmore Girls, right?). I fight the urge to text her from the car, knowing that if she responds while I am inside, I won’t be able to answer. Instead, I send her a Snapchat of my passive face, then turn my phone off and give it Dad to put in the glove box.</p><p> He looks at me with his mouth open, then closes it and nods. “That’s very mature, that’s a great idea.” He puts his phone in the glove box too. My mom peers at me in the rear view mirror and almost runs a stop sign.</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> “How do they keep their lilies away from the deer?” my mom remarks as we stroll up the Lieberman’s foliage-bounded front path. She leans down to inspect their flowers for some clue, but Dad pushes her along. She comes to the door, readjusts her hair and knocks. I roll my shoulders - my collar is making me sweat. I remind myself that September is still summer until the 21<sup>st</sup>.</p><p> As the door opens, a small dog tries to burst through the gap. An older woman with big blonde hair holds back the dog by its pink collar and ushers us inside. The dog barks loudest at me.</p><p> “You know, it’s about time I gave that dog something,” says the woman at the door, her smile wide enough that I see her gums, or maybe she just has one of those mouths.</p><p> The house smells like the dog, like hot food, like too many bodies, and like the potpourri that I saw in a silver tin on a side table. Next to it is an old picture of Teddy Lieberman, the deceased. He is in his high school lacrosse uniform, sans helmet, with sweaty greasepaint stains under each eye. It is a picture taken during the high school phase when smiling is out of fashion, a phase that I was only just exiting, I realize. I wonder if my funeral picture would have me smiling or not. If I died today. I hadn’t smiled in the Snapchat.</p><p> There are two dozen people in the main room, scattered across a beige couch and a row of folding chairs. The chairs are a nicer kind, with cushioning, so I figure that they are reserved for the older folk, which is most of the audience. These are people from my synagogue who I’ve seen for years, but I’ll never remember their names. One of them looks at me with wet eyes. I nod. They make a sound between a cough and a sneeze and I don’t bless them.</p><p> We make past the bodies to greet Mr. And Mrs. Lieberman. I don't know their first names. I wait my turn to give condolences, watching Mr. Lieberman, his face a rictus of exhaustion, as the words roll down him like raindrops. When I reached out to shake his hand, he hugs me. He isn’t a large man, but he’s very soft and smells of aftershave. Mrs. Lieberman, who taught me in Hebrew school in the third grade, strokes my hair. I feel that touch long after we wander away, even after I pin on a yarmulke and find a spot where near an air vent. It is a prime spot. The room soon fills with more visitors, Teddy’s friends who aren’t at college, or their parents. In the back, I don’t have to talk to any of them.</p><p> The rabbi isn’t the main one for the congregation, but the other guy. I like him. His corduroy pants were purchased sometime in the 90’s, probably older than I was. His voice rolls over words like an NPR host, and soon we’re nodding to his rhythm like the buoys in a lap pool.</p><p> He leads an abbreviated evening service filled with enough English that I don’t feel embarrassed or confused. I imagine the point of a Shiva isn't to make the guests self-conscious of their Hebrew skills. The Christians still seem mystified although the mention of a Valley with a Shadow of Death comforts them a little.</p><p> After the prayers, I try to find the restroom. The kitchen roils with old women, so I go back to the front door and around. I don’t find a bathroom, but I see Sam Stuckmeyer and another guy with long brown hair and red cheeks. Sam played lax with Teddy and life-guarded at my pool, which is how I knew him.</p><p> Sam waves me over and gives a laconic smile. He spent kindergarten in Texas which means that he is a McConaughey-acolyte in his use of hooded eyes and stretched vowel sounds.</p><p> “Hey, Liam.” (Haaaaaaay) “You look taller.”</p><p> “Wheaties, maybe?” I say. Sam nods which seems like approval.</p><p> “Where’s your sister?” asks the other guy.</p><p> I just shrug. He scoffs and shakes his head.</p><p> Sam digs at the carpet with his boat shoe. “I heard your Dad found Teddy.”</p><p> “Like in the park? No. He just looked at the teeth or something.”</p><p> “Gotcha.” Sam nods again, but this time with a more enigmatic squint. “Well, we were going to visit the park, if you want to join. Heat shoulda died down.”</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> We exit the Shiva. I don’t have my phone so if my parents wonder where I have gone, they’d have no clue. I like that. It is colder now, or at least breezy, which I like too. There aren’t as many gnats as I expect. On the lawn, I see the small dog on its side with glassy eyes and a slow, even, breathing pattern.</p><p> Sam and his friend talk for a while about college, which is mostly girls and parties, and then just sad things regarding girls they couldn’t figure out how to apologize to. I don’t mind the exclusionary nature of the conversation and I think they know. By the time we find a spot to sit cross-legged on the jungle gym, they’ve finished.</p><p> “I cut up my head over there – on the tube slide,” says Sam. “I tried to dive down head first and went too high, bust it open.” We say nothing. The cicadas screech and crickets sing. Finally, he finishes his thought. “Teddy was the only one not afraid of the blood. Walked me home.” We grumble our sympathy.</p><p> “Fuckin' sucks,” says the other guy, who’s name might have been Bryan, but not Brian. He picks up an errant wood chip and tosses it over the railing.</p><p> “What are the five stages of grief?” Sam asks.</p><p> “Denial, bargaining – no, denial, anger, bargaining, something, acceptance,” I reply.</p><p> “It’s not something; it’s <em>misery</em>,” Bryan says.</p><p> “Yeah, that’s right, depression,” I say.</p><p> Bryan shoots me a look, and then switches to Sam. He gives an upward head tic to his friend. Sam replies with yet another nod, this one followed by a slow blink. Bryan shifts one butt cheek up off the plastic so he can retrieve a lighter and an orange pill bottle from a back pocket. In the medicine bottle are a few joints. He withdraws one carefully.</p><p> No one speaks as he put it to his lips and lights it. He holds the smoke for three long seconds and blows it out. Sam takes it as Bryan passes it over. There is a small whisper when he inhales as the tip flares. When he is done, he holds it out before he's even exhaled. I reach for it, but he pulls it back.</p><p> “Wait.” Exhale. “Have you smoked before?”</p><p> I shake my head.</p><p> Sam looks at the Bryan. Bryan pushes his long hair out of his eyes.</p><p> “Maybe not tonight,” Sam says quietly, and without much drawl.</p><p> After that, Sam and Bryan take a few more hits each and then Bryan puts out the half smoked joint and returns it to the bottle. We walk back from the park in the dark. When we make it to the street, they go to Sam’s car instead of the Lieberman’s. I wave goodbye.</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> The dog is still on the lawn. Now, its eyes are closed and its tongue was out. It is still breathing. When I step inside the blonde woman is muttering to herself about the dog. I tell her it is outside and she leaves quickly.</p><p> My parents don't ask where I’ve been. My dad takes the keys from my mom and sits in the driver’s seat. He re-adjusts the seat and mirrors while humming one of the prayer melodies. My mom clutches a handkerchief in front of her face even though she wasn’t crying. I watch her in the rear view mirror for a long time until she notices me and I turn away.</p><p> Julia is at the table with books fanned out when we return. My mother hugs her and kisses her cheek and whispers something about love, while Julia tries not to cringe. Julia reassures Mom that just because she is going to college doesn’t mean that she was going to die.</p><p> I approach her too: “Some guy named Bryan wanted to know why you weren’t there.”</p><p> “What?”</p><p> “A friend of Sam Stuckmeyer? Brown hair?”</p><p> “I don't know who you're talking about.”</p><p> She probably wasn’t lying.</p><p align="center"> ***</p><p> There is a knock on my bedroom door, so I yell they can come in. My dad sticks his head in and then his hand holding my cellphone.</p><p> “Delivery.”</p><p> I turned it on to see what I’ve missed. Not much, and no reply from Julia to the Snapchat because it had never sent. I delete it. Then, I smile with teeth and all and take a new picture, which I send to her without a caption.</p><p> Five minutes later my phone buzzes – <em>Wut?</em></p><p> I think about my response and then type – <em>To remember me by</em></p>
