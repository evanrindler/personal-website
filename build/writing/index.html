He smiled at his reflection, held for three seconds while swiveling his head, and returned to his shrewd self-assessment. He’d need his eyebrows done before the interview with the Sheikh next Tuesday.</p></div>

Inside was a chunk of gold, a federal patent for land, and a letter.</p></div>

But young Henry was concerned to find Richards wilting now, for while his master looked as slumped as Henry was accustomed, the doctor was decidedly not wheezing and the only wet substance on his collar was ruby red.</p></div>

I noticed a man perched on the edge of one of the weathered cliffs, wearing a tartan cap and a moss green kilt. He stared out at the ocean and leaned forward like he was waiting forsomeone. I elbowed Harry and asked him what he thought of the man, Scotland’s first ambassador to us.</p></div>
